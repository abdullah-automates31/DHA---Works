# DHA Works

A home-services marketplace for DHA Karachi. A verified resident posts a repair job with photos, several **verified** workers send **itemised quotes**, the resident accepts one, the work is done, and the customer pays **cash**. DHA staff verify every worker and resident and handle reports.

> Status: **database and mobile API built, apps not started.** 15 migrations in `supabase/migrations`, all applied to the hosted DEV Supabase project; 217 pgTAP assertions pass. A push-notification Edge Function is built and tested locally but not deployed. No app code yet. Shariq Bhai approved Supabase (free tier) and the order: database and mobile APIs, then mobile apps, then the admin portal. Start new sessions with [docs/HANDOVER.md](docs/HANDOVER.md). The DB and API design is in [docs/DB-API-DESIGN.md](docs/DB-API-DESIGN.md).

## The three products

| Product | Who uses it | Tech |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DHA Works** (customer app) | DHA residents | Expo (React Native) + TypeScript, Android first |
| **DHA Works - Worker** (worker app) | Plumbers, electricians, AC technicians and similar | Expo (React Native) + TypeScript, Android first |
| **DHA admin portal** | DHA staff | Next.js + TypeScript on Vercel |

Backend for all three: **Supabase** (Postgres with Row Level Security, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions).

## Source of truth

These files were assembled from the Google Docs written during planning and then updated on 26 to 27 October 2026 to the competing-quotes model confirmed with Shariq Bhai and the three UI designs. Where a document says **Pending**, the decision has not been confirmed with Shariq Bhai. Where two sources disagree, [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) records which one wins.
